#summary Setting up your dev environment for working with the AfG codebase.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

There are three major components to the dev environment:

  * The frontend, which includes the allforgood.org website and API data feeds.
  * The backend data loader, which converts volunteer opportunities in various formats into AfG's internal representation.
  * The backend SOLR server, which indexes and stores the opportunities for retrieval by the frontend.

Setting up each component will be discussed below.

=Getting Started with Frontend Development=

The frontend is a [http://code.google.com/appengine/ Google App Engine] project, written in Python.  Google App Engine applications can be worked on using the Google App Engine SDK, which is available for all major platforms.
