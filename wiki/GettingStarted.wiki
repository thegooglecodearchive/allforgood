#summary Setting up your dev environment for working with the AfG codebase.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

There are three major components to the dev environment:

  * The frontend, which includes the allforgood.org website and API data feeds.
  * The backend data loader, which converts volunteer opportunities in various formats into AfG's internal representation.
  * The backend SOLR server, which indexes and stores the opportunities for retrieval by the frontend.

Setting up each component will be discussed below.

==Downloading the code==

All of the code is hosted on Google Code, and is available via SVN.

{{{
svn checkout http://allforgood.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ allforgood
}}}

The code is broken into a several directories:

  * datahub - The backend data loading code.  See Backend Development below for more details.
  * etc - contains some extraneous SVN setup scripts.
  * frontend - contains the Google App Engine project for the frontend (website and API).  See Frontend Development below for more details.
  * site_down - An alternative App Engine project for when AfG is in maintenance mode.
  * SOLR - the configuration files for the the SOLR Search Engine instance used by the backend.  See Backend Development below for more details.
  * spec - the specification for the Footprint XML format used to load volunteer opprotunities into All For Good.
  * tools - some tools for testing AfG quality.

=Getting Started with Frontend Development=

The frontend is a [http://code.google.com/appengine/ Google App Engine] project, written in Python.  Google App Engine applications can be worked on using the Google App Engine SDK, which is available for all major platforms.  

==Setting up the Google App Engine SDK==

Follow the Getting Started guide for the Google App Engine SDK, and [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html Download] the SDK for Python for your OS.
