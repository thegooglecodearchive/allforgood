<h3>Adding the All for Good Gadget to your Wordpress blog</h3>

<p>Here's how to set add an All for Good gadget to your WordPress blog sidebar.  Note that you can only install the gadget in the sidebar on your hosted blog, not on free accounts with WordPress.com.  Start by <a href="http://www.gmodules.com/ig/creator?synd=open&url=http%3A//www.allforgood.org/gadget/gadget.xml&h=315&w=250" target="_blank">going to this page.</a></p>

<p>Under Display settings, the Title is text that will appear above your gadget once it's placed in your blog template. You might enter "All for Good - Pets" and then set pets as a preferred keyword in the Gadget settings. Set the width of your gadget to 180 pixels.	 In this example, we left the border turned off because the blog column is already very narrow. Set Stories to read to 4. Enter your zip code.</p>
