<p STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in"><font size=2>It
is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that
comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which

and other applicable intellectual property laws. Responses may
include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the
subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers. If we
remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a
good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the
affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification
pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act. It is our policy
to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act. As
with all legal notices, a copy of the notice may be sent to one or
more third parties who may make it available to the public. </font>
