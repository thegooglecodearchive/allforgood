<h1>Our Good Works Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>Thank you for visiting this Our Good Works' Internet web site ("Site"). This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Our Good Works governing Our Good Works' use of personally identifiable information about users of our Site.</p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  However, in certain sections of this Site, we may invite you to login through a third party  social networking service, contact us with questions or comments, volunteer, request to build applications and submit product feedback.  Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information that you submit such as your login credentials, name, email address, zip code, organization name and organization website.  We may also collect additional personally identifiable information that you voluntarily transmit with your communications to us. </p>


<p>The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the aggregate number of users that click on a certain volunteer listing, search terms, IP address, browser type, the aggregate number of volunteers from particular cities, states and/or zip codes and other aggregate and anonymous information, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in anonymous and aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information.  For example, we may use this aggregate information to provide volunteer information in your area.</p>


<p>If you decide to use a social networking service to sign in, you are using other services like Facebook Connect and Friend Connect (which includes Yahoo!, AOL/AIM, Google and OpenID). These services give us a token that allows social features on the site, and this token is stored on our third party hosting provider's servers. The respective sign in services have privacy settings and policies that let you control your preferences. By default, those services use a cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for this Site to recognize when you return to the Site. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this feature. </p>

<p>
When you are signed in to the Site, you may send messages, "like" an activity and transmit information through various channels. We collect information from these activities through this Site so that we can provide you with our service and offer personalized features, such as your activity page.  In most cases, we retain this information so that, for instance, you can return to view activities you "like" or to easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable us to revert to the prior version of that information.  If you decide you don't want to have your activity page on the Site, and you're OK with having all history permanently removed, you'll need to fill out and submit the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=cmkzbjFkZ0hDOHpRRGRCQVA5ODlSSGc6MA..">Delete Account form</a>.
</p>

<h3>Use of Information</h3>

<p>We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver requested information or contact you to fulfill your requests, verify your authority to enter our Site and to improve the content and general administration of the Site.  We may use the aggregate information that we collect to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>

<p>You may share content from this Site with your friends using social networking services and such social networking services may collect and use your information as set forth in their own privacy policies.  We may provide the aggregate information that we collect to our third party partners that provide volunteer opportunities on this Site but such information will not personally identify you.  We may provide your personally identifiable information and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our Site and related services to you solely as necessary to provide our Site and services to you.  We may disclose your personally identifiable information when we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, or when we deem it appropriate or necessary to provide such information to law enforcement authorities.  We will not sell or transfer your personally identifiable information to any company or organization except that we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Our Good Works participates or to a non-profit assignee.  </p>


<h3>Cookies </h3>
<p>We and the third party social networking services through which you login to this Site may use small text files called cookies to improve the overall Site experience and to remember you when you visit this Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you but the cookies will store your user preferences.  </p>

<h3>Your Choices</h3>

<h3>Links to Third Party Sites </h3>

<p>The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Our Good Works does not have control ("External Web Sites").  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Our Good Works of those External Web Sites.  You acknowledge that Our Good Works is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Our Good Works is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites.  Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.</p>


<h3>Children's Privacy </h3>
<p>Our Good Works recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

<h3>Users Outside of the United States</h3>

<p>Our computer systems and some of the computer systems of our third party service providers are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the United States where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  As a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Our Good Works may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If so, Our Good Works will post a change notice and its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at this Site.  If any modification is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this Site. If you do not cease using this Site, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.</p>
