<h1>All for Good Product Guide</h1>

<p>All for Good (AFG) is a simple-to-use web application that helps you find volunteer opportunities in your local community.  You can get started by entering search terms (e.g. “seniors” or “education”) at the top of the All for Good home page.  Once you enter these initial keywords you’ll be taken to a page of relevant results that will also display a map that pinpoints where the opportunities occur, as well as a location search bar that will let you enter in different cities, states and zip codes to search.  For more detailed information about how to use All for Good, keep reading or watch the video below.  To learn more about All for Good as a product, visit our <a href="/about">About Us</a> page.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>The results of your search are based on three factors: the keywords you select (keywords are matched up to those in the descriptions of the different volunteer opportunities), location (opportunities that occur closer to you are more likely to appear) and time (opportunities that occur sooner are more likely to appear than those that occur later).  Play around with the site and try different search terms and locations to get different results!</p>

<h3>Social Features</h3>
<p>All for Good allows you to "share" your volunteer opportunities with people in a variety of ways, including through Twitter and MySpace.  You can also sign into networks like Facebook, Yahoo, Friend Connect and more.  Start by logging into your account in the upper-right hand corner of the All for Good homepage.  Then, when you find a volunteer opportunity that’s right for you, click “like” underneath it.  When your friends use the site they will then see your name beside opportunities you selected.  With networks like Facebook, you'll also have the option to send that event directly to your activity stream.  Once you've signed into a social network, be sure to check out AFG's activity page too.  You can use it to track the opportunities you've "liked".</p>

<h3>All for Good Across the Web</h3>
<p>As you go about your daily life on the Internet, you may occasionally notice All for Good in places other than allforgood.org. For example, AFG powers the search on serve.gov and a number of websites now feature an AFG gadget—a small, rectangular search box—to help you find volunteer opportunities.  Keep using whichever versions of All for Good you find and like!</p>

<h3>Alpha</h3>
<p>All for Good is still in an alpha phase.  That means you’ll occasionally notice new features that weren’t there before and more (and new!) volunteer opportunities will constantly be coming into AFG.  It also may mean you experience an occasional bug or can’t always find the exact opportunity you’re looking for in your community.  Keep checking back in!  We’re going to continue to add features and content for you to use and find.</p>
