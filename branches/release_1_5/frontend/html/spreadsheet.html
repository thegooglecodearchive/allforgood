<h1>Submit your volunteer listings to All for Good</h1>

<p>All for Good can help your organization find volunteers and reach a wider audience by spreading  volunteer activities on our website and across the web.</p>

<p>All for Good functions like a typical search engine - we list a "snippet" then direct people back to you to learn more about your volunteer activity and to sign up. The process works best when your full volunteer activity is available on a webpage that All for Good can list. We work with existing organizations and companies like VolunteerMatch, Idealist and MeetUp to gather and distribute volunteer activities listed through their websites.</p>

<h3><b>If you are an organization with fewer than 10 volunteer activities</b></h3>
<p>If you only have a few listings to post, the easiest way to get them on All for Good is to post them to one of our partner web sites.  These sites have already integrated their listings with All for Good, so anything you post there will automatically appear on All for Good.  (Note that this won't happen immediately, so don't worry if your listings don't appear on All for Good instantly.)  If you'd like to use this option, we recommend you post your activities on one of these sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idealist.org">www.idealist.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.serve.gov">www.serve.gov</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org">www.volunteermatch.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com">www.meetup.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your listings are already posted on one of these sites or any other site we already receive listings from (<a href="http://www.allforgood.org/about">see the list here</a>), you don't need to submit again!</p>

<h3><b>If you are an organization with 11-500 volunteer activities:</b></h3>

<p>The simplest way to submit your volunteer activities is by using the All for Good online spreadsheet template. </p>

<p>Online spreadsheets let you easily coordinate volunteer opportunities across offices and within a single team by inviting others to collaborate on the same spreadsheet.
Instructions:</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://tinyurl.com/allforgood-submit">http://tinyurl.com/allforgood-submit</a> and follow the instructions on the sheet.</p>

<p>For reference, the instructions are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Copy the spreadsheet linked to above (Go to "File" on the menu, and then go to "Create a Copy").  You can name the new copy anything.  This allows your organization to decide who can modify the data once it's live.
	<li>Delete the example events and add your own events.  Do not change the columns or add new ones, because the system won't run properly if you alter these settings.
	<li>Publish the spreadsheet by clicking on "Share" in the upper right-hand corner, then click on "Publish as a web page", then select "Automatically republish when changes are made."  This lets the system read your spreadsheet accurately.
	<li>Find your spreadsheet's web address by clicking "Share" then "Get the link to share." Right-click on the link and select "Copy."
	<li>Visit <a href="http://www.allforgood.org/sheetchecker/check">http://www.allforgood.org/sheetchecker/check</a> right-click and select "Paste" in the box that says "spreadsheet URL." This will check your spreadsheet for data errors, so that common mistakes don't slip through.
	<li>Once there are no errors, submit the spreadsheet using the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/google.com/viewform?formkey=ck9ZQ2lodDhxMUdRZ0RfVHVFSjJfX0E6MA..">Spreadsheet submission form</a>.  We use a form instead of e-mail because it's easier to track and doesn't get lost.
	<li>After you submit your form, please join the mailing list found on the Spreadsheet submission form so we can help you with any technical questions.

</ol>


<p>Note: We reserve the right to stop displaying any item that doesn't comply with <a href="/tos">All for Good's terms of service</a>..

</p>

<h3><b>Tips</b></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Update your spreadsheet as necessary. Once accepted, changes will be reflected within 24 hours.
	<li>Your spreadsheet will be "loaded" (also called "crawled"). And if everything works, your opportunities will be part of All for Good. Be careful when making final edits!
	<li>Google Spreadsheets makes it easy to import from Excel documents, but we don't recommend this because it's tricky to match the template format that the Google Spreadsheet scripts read. Instead, use cut and paste (from Excel to your browser) to move data into the spreadsheet.
	<li>Changes to the provided spreadsheets automatically go live within 24 hours, so be careful when editing. If you have major changes, feel free to re-submit a new sheet (a copy) for testing.
	<li>If your organization doesn't have a URL to link back to for volunteer opportunities, include as much information as possible in your spreadsheet.
	<li>For more information, contact us by filling out <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=clNlVENWQWNCc2U0RmZEYW5TWFdBelE6MA">this form</a>.

</ul>


<h3>If you are an organization with more than 500 volunteer activities:</h3>

<p>The best way to submit your activities is using an XML feed.  Here are simple steps to get started:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>You can find the url spec here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/footprint2009dev/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/footprint2009dev/downloads/list</a>
	<li>Provide a production URL we can crawl with your updated data -- this can be a "live" database query, or a nightly dump. Submit your feed on the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=clhBZU1KQTZBUjRoUTU1N1RLSmlkX2c6MA..">XML Submission Form</a>.

		<ul>
		<li>The URL can be hosted anywhere.  We'd strongly prefer plain HTTP -- no redirects, passwords, HTTPS or FTP.
		<li>Please keep the data to N=1M records or X=20MB (compressed ok), picking the "best" records to place in this set.  If you can't do that (e.g. engineering resources), we may take the first N records and X bytes on our end.
		<li>Contents of the URL should be updated "atomically" (all at once), otherwise timing bugs can leave us with a partial and/or corrupted file.
		<li>Reasonable up-time and bandwidth -- the crawler will visit 1-10 times per day, and download the file
		as quickly as you let us.  If the URL is down at the time we crawl, we may not revisit until the next day.
		<li>Please include an operational contact in case we have technical or quality problems with the feed.
		</ul>

	</ul>


	<h3><b>Editing listings</b></h3>
	<p>We've received some requests to update incorrect information appearing in listings on All for Good.  Because All for Good crawls other sites to aggregate listings, we cannot modify listings directly.  If you would like to change how your listings appear on All for Good, you will need to do so at the source of the listing.  You can see the web site that is providing a listing in gray on the last line of the listing, before "Like" and "Share".</p>
