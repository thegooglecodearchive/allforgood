<h1>Posting Volunteer Listings</h1>

<p>We're excited to be able to help your organization reach more potential volunteers across the country.  This page includes several options on posting your listings - please review them and choose the method that will work best for your organization.</p>

<h3>Option One: Posting Through Partner Sites (Recommended for 1-5 listings)</h3>
<p>If you only have a few listings to post, the easiest way to get them on All for Good is to post them to one of our partner web sites.  These sites have already integrated their listings with All for Good, so anything you post there will automatically appear on All for Good.  (Note that this won't happen immediately, so don't worry if your listings don't appear on All for Good instantly.)  If you'd like to use this option, we recommend you post your activities on one of these sites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.idealist.org">www.idealist.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.serve.gov">www.serve.gov</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org">www.volunteermatch.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com">www.meetup.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your listings are already posted on one of these sites or any other site we already receive listings from (<a href="http://www.allforgood.org/about">see the list here</a>), you don't need to submit again!</p>

<h3>Option Two: Online Spreadsheets (Recommended for 5-100 listings)</h3>
<p>If your organization has more than a few regular volunteer opportunities to post and would like to feed them directly to All for Good, you can upload a spreadsheet of your listings in a specific format to have them included on the site.  This option requires some work on your end, but does not require any detailed technical or programming knowledge.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/afg-spreadsheet-template">Follow the directions here</a> to post listings through spreadsheets.  (Note that listings may take up to 24 hours to appear using this option.)</p>

<h3>Option Three: XML Feeds (Recommended for large organizations with technical resources)</h3>
<p>If your organization anticipates posting large numbers of volunteer opportunities on a continuing basis, it's possible for your organization to create a XML feed of your listings following our specifications that we will automatically import and continually crawl for new listings.  Note that this option will require technical resources on your end, and is not the fastest or easiest option for adding a small number of listings.  If you are interested in using this option, please reply to this email and we'll be in touch.</p>

<h3>Editing Listings</h3>
<p>We've received some requests to update incorrect information appearing in listings on All for Good.  Because All for Good crawls other sites to aggregate listings, we cannot modify listings directly.  If you would like to change how your listings appear on All for Good, you will need to do so at the source of the listing.  You can see the web site that is providing a listing in gray on the last line of the listing, before "Like" and "Share".</p>

<p>We look forward to including your listings on All for Good!</p>
