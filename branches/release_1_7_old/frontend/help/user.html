<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Footprint is an aggregator of volunteer opportunities. These events are collected from numerous sites and organizations and presented to you in a single place. Further, Footprint allows you to submit new or highlight existing opportunities you're interested in and share them with your friends.</p>

<h2 id="Searching">Searching</h2>
<p>Loading <a href="http://servicefootprint.appspot.com/">http://servicefootprint.appspot.com/</a> alone is enough begin. The site defaults to the <strong>Find an event</strong> tab with a generic search for the latest volunteer opportunities added. You may then use the location, keyword and calendar settings to refine the results and find something near you of interest at a suitable date and time. The two search boxes work in this manner:</p>
<p><em>Located near </em>- accepts address or intersection, city and state, a landmark, or numeric coordinates</p>
<p><em>Matching keywords</em> - accepts any word or phrase with the latter requiring quotes and supports exclusion by preceding the undesired term with a minus sign</p>
<p>To retrieve a feed of opportunities from Footprint, see the <a href="reference.html">Footprint API Reference Guide</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>If you want to take advantage of Footprint's social functions, you'll need to log in.</p>
<h2 id="Logging">Logging in</h2>
<p>To more easily interact with other social services, Footprint allows authentication over <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect/">Google Friend Connect</a> using existing accounts on popular sites. So you may log into Footprint by clicking the appropriate service icon at the top right and then entering your username and password for that service. You will also be presented with the option to create a new Google account if needed.</p>
<h2 id="Highlighting">Highlighting, scheduling and sharing</h2>
<p>Once you're logged in, you may highlight any opportunity you're interested in by clicking the star next to the event in the search results list. This opportunity will now appear within your <strong>My Events</strong> tab whenever you're logged in.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may add the opportunity to your social service's online calendar by clicking the calendar icon next to the event and then confirming the addition. The opportunity date and time then appears in calendar on the day noted.</p>
<p>Finally, you may share opportunities you and your friends have starred by visiting the <strong>Work with others</strong> tab. To add friends, visit other members' profiles by clicking on names and faces on the site, and then click &quot;Add as friend&quot; to send a friend request.</p>
<p>To share the entire Footprint site and concept with a potentially new member, click the &quot;Invite&quot; link at the top right and either select the users from those presented by your social service of choice, or click the <strong>Share</strong> subtab to select from other social service sites and providers.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be logged into each of the sites to be shared with for your invitations to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="Adding">Adding events</h2>
<p>In addition to collecting volunteer opportunities from other sites, Footprint allows users to submit events directly to the site. To do this, click the <strong>Add an event</strong> tab and complete and submit the form, making sure to include the words at the bottom to fulfill the reCaptcha request.</p>
<p>To establish a feed of opportunities for consumption by Footprint, contact <a href="mailto:footprint-eng@googlegroups.com">footprint-eng@googlegroups.com</a> for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="Updating">Updating personal settings</h2>
<p>After logging in, you may update your personal settings by clicking the &quot;Settings&quot; link at the top right. The default <strong>Basics</strong> subtab allows you to build your profile, import it from another service, and restrict access to it. You may also choose to publish your Footprint activities on other sites you belong to here.</p>
