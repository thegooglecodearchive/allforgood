Spatial Solr is a Solr plugin that enables geo-location search in Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr). This plugin is a
standalone version of a publicly available patch. The main goal of this plugin is to remove the need to patch and use
your own custom version of Solr, but instead use the offical Solr distribution. JTeam is actively involved in the
comminuty effort to get this patch into the Solr code base as well.
