<h1>All for Good Content Policy</h1>
<p>All for Good is a way for organizations and individuals to get involved in volunteer projects. Organizers can post volunteering opportunities and participants can then sign up to join these events. The All for Good Content Policy plays an important role in maintaining a positive experience for everyone using All for Good, so projects listed in All for Good must adhere to these policies:</p>
<h3>Age Restrictions</h3>
<p>To use the All for Good product, you must be at least 13 years old. This applies to signing up for projects and any other use of All for Good.<br>
We do not allow projects soliciting volunteers under the age of thirteen.</p>
<h3>Non-Volunteer Projects</h3>
<p>We do not allow posting for projects that are not volunteering opportunities. For example, we do not allow projects where the primary beneficiary of the project is a for-profit organization.</p>
<h3>Spam, Malware and Phishing</h3>
<p>We do not allow spam, including posting the same content repeatedly or advertising non-volunteer content or businesses. <br />
  We do not allow malware, including viruses or anything that may disrupt service or harm other users. <br />
We do not allow malicious scripts and password phishing scams.</p>
<h3>Violence</h3>
<p>We do not allow content that is violent in nature, including direct threats of violence against any person or group of people.</p>
<h3>Hate Speech</h3>
<p>We do not allow content that promotes hatred towards groups of people based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity.</p>
<h3>Nudity and Sexually Explicit Material</h3>
<p>We do not allow content that includes nudity, graphic sex acts, or sexually explicit material.<br />
We do not allow activity intended to drive traffic to commercial pornography sites.<br />
We do not allow content that promotes pedophilia, incest, or bestiality. <br />
We have a zero-tolerance policy against child pornography. If we become aware of child pornography, the content will be removed and we WILL report these listings/accounts and their owners to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<h3>Private &amp; Confidential Information</h3>
<p>We do not allow unauthorized publishing of people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, driver's and other license numbers, account passwords, or any other information that is not publicly accessible.</p>
<h3>Illegal Activities</h3>
<p>We do not allow All for Good to be used for unlawful purposes or for promotion of dangerous and illegal activities. If we become aware of such activity, we will remove these listings/accounts, notify law enforcement authorities, or take other appropriate action.</p>
<p>Postings must note if there are any legally required conditions for participation. For example, if a project requires the volunteer to have a valid license of some kind (e.g. a medical license, etc.), this must be stated in the project description.</p>
