<h3>Why should I use All for Good?</h3>

Each of us has a role to play in improving our communities and our country. Small deeds can add up and make a big difference. All for Good makes it simple to find and share ways to do good.

<h3>Do I need to sign in to use the site?</h3>

Though you don't need to sign in to search for volunteer activities, signing in will allow you to interact with your friends, making service a social experience. To sign in, just select your primary social network. Once logged in, you'll be able to connect and share with friends from that network.

<h3>What accounts do you support?</h3>

You may now sign in with the following accounts:<br>
<li>Facebook Connect
<li>Google
<li>Yahoo
<li>AIM/AOL
<li>OpenID

<h3>What's "like"?</h3>

Once signed in, you have the ability to "like" a volunteer activity. This means that you think it's interesting for one reason or another and want to share that good vibe with others in the commuity. Once you "like" an activity, your friends will be able to see that you've liked it when they are browsing activities. This may cause others to become interested in it, too.

<h3>When I'm using Facebook, can my friends see what I like?</h3>

If you sign in with Facebook, you have the option to share activities you like with your Facebook friends through your Facebook activity stream. Sharing lets your friends know about the great activities they're missing! If you don't want to share what you like with your Facebook friends, you can select not to in the Facebook pop-up box you'll see after clicking "like."&nbsp;

<h3>Why do sometimes I see my friends' names in the results?</h3>

Seeing your friends' names is a result of your friends "liking" an activity. If you're interested in the same activity, you can choose to like it, too.

<h3>What is Google Friend Connect?</h3>

Google Friend Connect is a simple way for you to sign in to a website using accounts from other sites, including: Yahoo, AOL, OpenID and Google.
Doing this allows you to interact and communicate with the friends they've already established on those networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3>I'm not getting any results when I search. &nbsp;What do I do?</h3>

Try broadening your location or keywords. For instance, instead of Sausalito, CA, search for San Francisco, CA. Being less specific will produce more results.
