<h1>Team</h1>
<p/>
We are a self-organized crew of software engineers, marketing managers, community builders, product developers and designers who all believe in the vision of All for Good. We believe that service should be ubiquitous across the web and technology can play a positive role in facilitating service and strengthening our communities.
<p/>
Our core team is made up of enthusiasts from places like Google, Craigslist Foundation, UCLA, YouTube, EchoDitto, FanFeedr and Aha! Ink. As a contributor to the All for Good project, Google is hosting the All for Good website and products. Several Google engineers worked on All for Good as a 20-percent project (Google lets engineers spend a day a week on projects that interest them), collaborating with a broader team to build the product.
<p/>
Lots of individuals and companies came together to get All for Good off the ground. Founding activity providers include 1-800-volunteer.org, 1 Sky, AARP, American Solutions for Winning the Future, American Red Cross, City of New York, The Corporation for National and Community Service, craigslist, Girl Scouts of the USA, Habitat for Humanity, HandsOn Network and Points of Light Institute, Idealist, MeetUp, Mentor, Network for Good, Organizing for America, ServeNet.org, Sierra Club, TechMission, The Extraordinaries, Truist, United Jewish Communities, United Way, Volunteer2, and Youth Service America.
<p/>
In early 2011, All for Good began talks with the Points of Light Institute team to merge. Points of Light Institute is a leader in the nonprofit service field and can help All for Good grow with an improved product and broader network of partners benefiting the entire service community.
