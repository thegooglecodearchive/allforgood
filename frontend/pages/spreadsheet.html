<h2>Add Opportunities</h2>
<p>
There are three different ways to add your volunteer listings to the All for Good search engine - using our spreadsheet template, via an XML data feed of your opportunities created by your IT team, or if you have less than ten opportunities we encourage you to use one of our partner sites.  The best process to use depends on the number of volunteer opportunities you plan to submit and if you will be updating them with any frequency.  If you have any questions regarding what is the best approach for your organization or encounter technical difficulties, please send an email to <a href="mailto:provider-support@allforgood.org">provider-support@allforgood.org</a> and someone will respond as soon as possible.

<h3>Posting 10 or More Opportunities Using Our Spreadsheet Template</h3>
<p>
The easiest way for organizations that want to list opportunities in All for Good is to use our online spreadsheet template.  This template lets you easily share data across multiple staff members and offices in order to better coordinate your organization's opportunities and listings.  You can control who in your organization has access to the spreadsheet and can update your opportunities as needed.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://tinyurl.com/allforgood-submit">here</a> to access the spreadsheet template.  Please follow the instructions there to create your own opportunity spreadsheet and how to submit it for processing.  Please note that:</p>

<p>
<ul style="margin-left:48px;">
   <li>Google Spreadsheets makes it easy to import from Excel documents, but we do not recommend doing it.  The template format that the Google Spreadsheet scripts read is fairly exact, and Excel often has a hard time matching to it. Instead of importing, use cut and paste (from Excel to your browser) to move data into the spreadsheet.</li>
   <li>Changes to the provided spreadsheets automatically go live within 24 hours, so be careful when editing. If you have major changes, feel free to re-submit a new sheet (a copy) for testing.</li>
   <li>If your organization does not have a URL to link back to for volunteer opportunities please link to your website's home page or contact page so potential volunteers can contact you if necessary.</li>
   <li>For more information, contact us by email at <a href="maito:provider-support@allforgood.org">provider-support@allforgood.org</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Posting 10 or More Opportunities by Creating Your Own XML Data Feed To Us</h3>
<p>The best way to submit a large number of opportunities and keep them automatically updated in our system is to create your own XML data feed file for processing by us.  If your IT department requires any technical support to get your initial feed file to us set up, feel free to contact us at <a href="maito:provider-support@allforgood.org">provider-support@allforgood.org</a> with any questions. Here are the steps to get started:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:48px;">
   <li>You can find the URL specification here, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/allforgood/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/allforgood/downloads/list</a> for how to set up your XML feed file.</li>
   <li>Once you have setup your feed file creation process, then please provide us with production URL we can crawl on a few times per day to download your updated data.  Contact us to submit your feed by emailing <nowrap><a href="mailto:provider-support@allforgood.org">provider-support@allforgood.org</a></nowrap>.  Note that:</li>
         <ul style="margin-left:48px;">
          <li> The URL can be hosted anywhere. We strongly prefer plain HTTP -- no redirects, passwords, HTTPS or FTP.</li>
          <li> Please keep the file  size to less than 500,000 records and less than 200MB.</li>
          <li> The contents of your feed file should be updated "atomically" (all at once) by your system, otherwise our system may attempt to download a partial or corrupted version of your file for processing.</li>
          <li> Please include an operational contact in case we have technical or quality problems with the feed.</li>
          <li> Any updates to your feed file should appear live in our system within 24 hours.</li>
	 </ul>
   <li>Please note that all data feed submissions to All for Good are subject to our <a href="/cla">Content License Agreement</a>. Before we can process your feed, you must indicate your acceptance of the agreement by <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dHVnbll2RzdESGRRU2NqMDM4V0F0YXc6MA..">completing this form</a></li>

<h3>Posting Less Than 10 Opportunities via Our Partner Sites</h3>
<p>The best method for small organizations to list a small number of their opportunities with All for Good is to use one of our partner sites.  If you have already posted your opportunities at <a href="http://www.idealist.org/create-content">Idealist.org</a> or <a href="http://createthegood.org/sso/required/post-opportunity">Createthegood.org</a>, they will automatically be added to the All for Good database within 48 hours.  There is no need to cross-post listings to All for Good that have already been listed at one of these sites.</p>
