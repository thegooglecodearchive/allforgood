<h3>What is All for Good? Why should I use it?</h3>
<p>All for Good makes it simple to find ways to do good by helping people connect with service activities in their communities. The site brings together service opportunities from local and national organizations to help you find volunteer activities that fit your time and interests.</p>

<h3>How large is the All for Good database?</h3>
<p>Each month there are over 150,000 listings in the system representing over a million volunteer opportunities making All for Good one of the largest databases of its kind. Of course, size isn't the only thing that matters, and we put just as much emphasis on search quality, listing quality, user interfaces, site speed and the many other factors that together help make All for Good useful.</p>

<h3>How does the site work?</h3>
<p>All For Good works as a search engine for volunteer opportunities. You can search for opportunities based on factors like location and interests, and a list of opportunities is generated matching your specifications.   Listings include brief descriptions of the opportunity and a link to the source website, where you can get more information and contact the volunteer organization directly.  All For Good doesn't administer volunteer activities directly - think of it as a one-stop access point to the world of volunteering.</p>
