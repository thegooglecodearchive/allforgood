<h1>All for Good  API Reference Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The All for Good  application programming interface (API) allows client applications to retrieve and view the content of <a href="http://www.allforgood.org/">http://www.allforgood.org/</a>, which collects and presents volunteer opportunities posted to numerous sites. Your client application can use the All for Good API to request a list of volunteer opportunities using a number of parameters documented here.</p>
<p>Please note that your use of the API is subject to the <a href="/api_tos">API Terms of Service</a> and you are required to display a "Powered by All for Good" logo in whatever search interfaces you develop that utilize the All for Good API.</p>

<h2 id="Audience">Audience</h2>
<p>This document is intended for programmers who want to write client applications that can interact with All for Good, an open source aggregator of volunteer opportunities. It provides reference documentation for using the All for Good API, however it doesn't contain information about the programming-language client libraries.</p>
<h2 id="Licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>It should be noted that the use of particular subsets of All for Good data may be subject to restrictions and third party licenses.  For example, some providers supply listings data under a Creative Commons license, specifically <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0</a>. Partners are required to observe such compliance requirements.     
</p>
<h2 id="Access">Access</h2>
<p>First, request a key to use the All for Good API by completing the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=cmV2MWhwSmpBMUdZV3dtRG5UWFljdlE6MA..">API Key form</a>. Once that request has been fulfilled, you may then use the API  available at:<br />
<a href="http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps">http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps</a></p>
<p>As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>-based API, All for Good provides all output over HTTP at distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>, which makes it easy to test applications with browsers and command-line web clients. All for Good contains listings of volunteer opportunities, which today are defined as events (offline or online), optionally containing locations and start-end times.</p>
<p>In their simplest form, listings have just a title, description and basic contact, time and location information.  In their fullest form, listings can contain dozens of detailed fields, as described in the <a href="#Elements">Elements</a> section and associated <a href="http://www.allforgood.org/spec">specification</a>. Because of the short lifespan of the volunteer opportunities, the frequency with which they change, and our data partner agreements, the search results should not be stored in your local system.</p>
<h2 id="Parameters">Query parameters</h2>
<p>All for Good uses <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/reference.html#Queries">Google conventions on query parameters</a>, e.g. q=... is used for keyword search, num= specifies the number of results and start= sets offset for pagination.</p>
<p>The syntax for API calls requires following the aforementioned All for Good  API URL (<a href="http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps">http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps</a>) with a question mark (?) and then a parameter name, equal sign (=), and value. Here's the syntax for constructing API calls:<br />
  <code>http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps?<em>parameter_name</em>=<em>value</em></code></p>
<p>For instance, a query for location would use the vol_loc parameter:<br />
<code>http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps?vol_loc=<em>City</em>+<em>Name</em>,<em>STATEABBREV</em></code></p>
<p>Multiple parameter and value combinations may be included in a single call by joining them with an ampersand(&amp;), like so:<br />
<code>http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps?<em>parameter_name1</em>=<em>value</em>&amp;<em>parameter_name2</em>=<em>value</em></code></p>
<p>The All for Good Data API supports the following query parameters:<br />

    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>Values</th>

      <td><p>Default value: none</p>
      <p>Expected values: any string,  including quoted phrases (&quot;some terms&quot;), and exclusions (-excluded_term).</p>
	  <p>Note that by default all search terms are required.  Boolean "OR" queries are supported, but if passed must be enclosed in parentheses.  For instance, if you wish to query for all opportunities than include the terms "veteran" or "military", the appropriate q syntax would be "q=(veteran OR military)".</p></td>

      <td><code>merge</code></td>
      <td>The API by default returns individual results for each occurrence of a reoccurring data event and does not merge together opportunities that occur in multiple locations within the search radius.  However, since to the end user of your application recurring or multi-geo opportunities may appear as <code>duplicates</code> or overly similar to each other, the API supports returning only the single most relevant instance of such opportunities via the optional <code>merge</code> parameter.</td>
      <td><p>Default value: none</p>
      <p>Expected values: 0 (no merging), 1 (merges recurring/multi-geo opps into one result)</p></td>

<h2 id="Formats">Output formats</h2>
<p>The All for Good  API provides its output in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>JSON</em> - A machine-readable format that is currently recommended for all uses other than debugging. You can specify this setting by appending the API call with: <code>&amp;output=json</code></li>
  <li><em>RSS</em> - A machine-readable format that is currently recommended for all uses other than debugging. You can specify this setting by appending the API call with: <code>&amp;output=rss</code></li>
  <li><em>HTML</em> - A  human-readable format that's currently dedicated to debugging. This is the default and will appear whenever you load the API without the output parameter and can be manually set with: <code>&amp;output=html</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Fields">Output fields</h2>
<p>Generally, the output fields correspond to the input fields found in FPXML (see the <a href="#Elements">Elements</a> section).</p>
<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Here are some example queries made against the All for Good  API to help you see how the API works. We've appended <code>&amp;output=rss</code> to each query to get machine-readable output.</p>
<p>Listings near San Francisco:<br />

<p>And here is an example of an All for Good query called from a program, this one written in Java:</p>
<pre>
URLConnection connection;
URL url = new URL
     &quot;http://www.allforgood.org/api/volopps?output=rss&amp;vol_loc=&quot; +
     location);
connection = url.openConnection();
connection.connect();
InputStream stream = connection.getInputStream();</pre>
<h2 id="Elements">Elements</h2>
<p>All for Good stores one record per location, i.e. if an event has multiple locations, there's one record per location.  Likewise, for repeated events, we store one record per time range. These elements are described in the <a href="/spec">All for Good XML specification for data received from providers.</a></p>
<h2 id="Notes">Developer notes and requests</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>maximum results</em> - As with most search engines, we have limits on the number of result records, both per query (100) and total (TBD). Please ask us if you need to download all results, and explain why.</li>
  <li><em>ranking / sorting</em> -  Record sorting ('ranking') is based on a number of variables such as when the opportunity will occur, its geographic proximity to the search location.  If you have questions about our ranking algorithm, please contact us.</li>
  <li><em>keyword stemming/plurals/etc</em> - We use the open source Solr search engine as the underlying provider for keyword queries, so your search results should match alternate word forms.  As with all search engines, please don't rely on this-- and don't hesitate to file bugs with us if you don't get expected behavior.</li>
  <li><em>keyword queries on various fields</em> - q= queries the opportunity title, opportunity description, organization name, and data provider name fields.  There's no way to restrict to fewer fields.</li>
  <li><em>skills field</em> - Due to the data from providers, the skills field is currently unstructured, i.e. you can't run restriction-searches on it.</li>
  <li><em>querying on the skills field </em>- Not supported beyond : keyword search only (providers  have only longhand descriptions).</li>
  <li><em>repeated URL parameters</em> - If multiple URL parameters are provided, we take the last of them, e.g. &amp;cats=foo&amp;cats=bar is the same as &amp;cats=bar.</li>
  <li><em>unknown URL parameters</em> - Unknown API arguments are ignored.</li>
  <li><em>bookmarking query URLs</em> - Yes, you may bookmark query URLs including emailing them, linking to them, etc. </li>
  <li><em>caching results</em> - Yes, you may cache results for at least 1 hour.  Please contact us if you want to cache for longer.</li>
