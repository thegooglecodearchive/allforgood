<h3>About Us</h3>
<p/>
Inspired by the call of President Obama to engage more Americans in service, a group of individuals from the technology, marketing and public sectors came together in 2009 to build an open source application that allows you to find and share service opportunities. All for Good lets you browse activities and find events based on your location or interests. The site is governed by Our Good Works a nonprofit organization that was formed by some of the people who initiated the project and who support the product's growth.

<h3>How did All for Good get started?</h3>
<p/>
When President Obama called on Americans to get out and serve even before he took office, people who led the online and on the ground effort looked to Silicon Valley (where lots of tech companies start and settle) for new tools to engage in service. All this chatter ultimately turned into a groundswell of individuals from varied backgrounds — technology, marketing, academia, non-profit— coming together to volunteer their time and talents to create All for Good.
<p/>
From that initial spark, our ad hoc crew worked to bring the idea to life. Companies and organizations joined in and donated resources to help turn a shared idea into a reality.
